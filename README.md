## Fake News Detection in English and Spanish 

## Project Overview  - Introduction 

In today's world, there is an overwhelming amount of information being communicated via social media or news sites. There are even parody news sites that some may mistake as real, factual news sites. Sometimes, people will even deliberately spread misinformation for nefarious reasons like hurting a person's reputation. With how easy it is for people to spread misinformation online, it has become increasingly difficult to recognize the truth over 'fake news'. 

According to the Cambridge Dictionary, the definition of "fake news": 
> false stories that appear to be news, spread on the internet or using other media, usually created to influence political views or as a joke 

Given the prevalence of fake news, I wanted to try to try detecting fake news, myself. I was also interested in fake news detection in languages other than English. I was able to find fake news detection models for Urdu, Japanese, and Spanish. Since I am fluent in Spanish, I decided to also focus upon fake news detection in Spanish. I was also curious to see how well English based fake news detection models dealt with Spanish datasets translated into English compared to the fake news detection models made using Spanish. I used Google Translate for the translation from Spanish to English. I am aware that translations are not entirely accurate and can impact the meaning of the news, but the results of the models in both languages may not be surprising.
