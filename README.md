## Fake News Detection in English and Spanish 

## Project Overview  - Introduction 

In today's world, there is an overwhelming amount of information being communicated via social media or news sites. There are even parody news sites that some may mistake as real, factual news sites. Sometimes, people will even deliberately spread misinformation for nefarious reasons like hurting a person's reputation. With how easy it is for people to spread misinformation online, it has become increasingly difficult to recognize the truth over 'fake news'. 

According to the Cambridge Dictionary, the definition of "fake news": 
    false stories that appear to be news, spread on the internet or using other media, usually created to influence political views or as a joke
